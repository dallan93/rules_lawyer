The following pages contain \neverything you need to know in order to wage glorious battle across the war-torn galaxy of the 41st Millennium.\nWarhammer 40,000 is a tabletop war \ngame in which players command armies of Citadel miniatures and attempt to defeat their opponent through a mixture \nof skill, tactics and luck. Storytelling is \nat the core of Warhammer 40,000, with the rules designed to bring to life the epic conflicts between the forces of Mankind, aliens and daemons in the grim darkness of the far future. The purpose of the game is for all players to have an enjoyable shared experience, putting their tactical skills to the test while admiring the spectacle of amazing miniatures clashing on fantastic battlefields. In this spirit, good sportsmanship and politeness are at the heart of the game.Games of Warhammer 40,000 are won by scoring more Victory points than your opponent through achieving various objectives, from recovering vital relics to capturing enemy strongholds or eliminating the opposing Warlord.\nThe game is played in a series of battle \nrounds, broken into different phases during which players move, shoot and \nfight with their miniatures.In a game as wide-ranging as \nWarhammer 40,000, there may be times when you are not sure exactly how to resolve a situation that has come up during play. When this happens, have a quick chat with your opponent and apply the solution that makes the most sense to both of you (or seems the most fun!). If no single solution presents itself, you and your opponent should roll off, \nand whoever rolls highest gets to choose \nwhat happens.

        "text": "CORE CONCEPTS (PG 5-9)\nAn introduction to the essential rules terms and concepts \nthat underpin every Warhammer 40,000 battle.\nTHE BATTLE ROUND (PG 10-36)\nFrom manoeuvring your army to unleashing thunderous firepower and brutal assaults, the action in Warhammer 40,000 unfolds in a series of battle rounds in which each player takes a turn.\nDATASHEETS AND UNIT \nABILITIES (PG 37-39)\nEvery Warhammer 40,000 unit has a datasheet, reflecting \nthe characteristics and abilities they can draw upon in battle.\nSTRATEGIC RESERVES AND \nSTRATAGEMS (PG 41-43)\nFrom well-timed Strategic Reserves to deftly executed \nStratagems, gifted generals make use of all the tactical advantages at their disposal.\nTERRAIN FEATURES (PG 44-52)\nWarhammer 40,000 battles are fought across all manner of grim and perilous landscapes, often strewn with ruins, wreckage and other obstacles your forces must navigate while they fight.\nMUSTER YOUR ARMY (PG 55-56)\nUse these steps before battle to organise your warriors and war machines into a formidable fighting force.\nMISSIONS  (PG 57-60)\nBefore committing your forces to war, you must first establish your strategic goals and the nature of the battlefield to be fought over. This section presents the essential steps involved in preparing for any kind of Warhammer 40,000 battle.ABILITIES\nMany units in Warhammer 40,000 have one or more abilities listed on their datasheets that they can use in battle. Some of the most common of these are not written out in full on those datasheets, but are instead only referenced by name; the full details of these can be found on the Core Rules pages ahead, marked with the symbol shown on the right.\nHINTS AND TIPS\nSome pages feature Hints and Tips, covering topics like dice-rolling practices and how to ensure you don’t damage your models while moving them around the battlefield. Note that these are not rules, they are simply pieces of advice you may find useful to apply to \nyour own games.\nSUMMARIES\nSome rules on the pages ahead include \nbullet-pointed summaries for quick reference purposes. Note that these are not comprehensive, and you should always consult the full rules if you are unsure.\nPAGE NUMBERS\nThroughout the Core Rules you will find page numbers shown within stylised triangles (see below). These function independently from any other page numbers within a publication; any page references found within the Core Rules – and any page references to the Core Rules found elsewhere – are based on this system, and do not \nrelate to any other page \nnumbers outside of the Core Rules.\nMISSIONS\nTo play a game of Warhammer 40,000, you must first select a \nmission. The mission will tell you how to muster your armies, create your battlefield and deploy your forces on the tabletop. It will also tell you any special rules that apply to the battle, and (most importantly!) what you need to do to win. Y ou can find out more about missions on pages 57-58.\nARMIES\nEach player in a game of Warhammer 40,000 commands an army of Citadel miniatures, hereafter referred to as models. The mission you have selected will guide you as to how big your army should be. \n ■Army: All of the models under your command.\nUNITS\nModels move and fight in units. A unit can have one or more models from a single datasheet (see below). Models and units from the same army are said to be friendly in relation to each other. Models and units from your opponent’s army are referred to as enemy models and units. If a rule affects ‘models’ or ‘units’ without specifying that they are friendly or enemy, that rule affects all models or all units, regardless of whose army they are in.\n ■Unit: One or more models from the same datasheet.\n ■ Friendly Models/Units: All models/units from the \nsame army.\n ■ Enemy Models/Units: All models/units from your \nopponent’s army.\nDATASHEETS\nThe rules you will need to use your models in games are \npresented on datasheets. Each unit has a datasheet; \nyou will need the datasheets for all the units \nfrom your army. Y ou can find out more about datasheets on pages 37-38.\nKEYWORDS \nAll datasheets have a list of keywords, separated into Faction keywords and other keywords. Faction keywords can be used to help you decide which models to include in your army, but otherwise both sets of keywords are functionally the same. In either case, keywords appear in Keyword Bold. Keywords are sometimes linked to (or ‘tagged’ by) a rule. For example, a rule might say that it applies to Infantry units. This means it only applies to units that have the Infantry keyword on their datasheet. The pluralisation (or otherwise) of keywords does not affect which units the rule in question applies to. CORE CONCEPTS\nThis section introduces various rules terms that you will find throughout the Core Rules and beyond. \nThese key concepts form the basis of the Warhammer 40,000 rules, and are essential for every kind of battle.\n5\nENGAGEMENT RANGE\nEngagement Range represents the zone of threat that models present to their enemies. While a model is within 1\" horizontally and 5\" vertically of an enemy model, those models – and their units – are within Engagement Range of each other.\nModels cannot be set up or end a Normal, Advance or Fall \nBack move within Engagement Range of any enemy models. If for any reason a model cannot meet this condition, that model is destroyed. \n ■  Engagement Range: Within 1\" horizontally and \n5\" vertically.\n ■  Models cannot be set up within Engagement Range of \nenemy models.\nBATTLEFIELD\nBattles of Warhammer 40,000 are fought on rectangular battlefields. This can be any surface upon which the models can stand – a dining table, for example, or the floor. Y our mission will guide you as to the size of battlefield required.\nTERRAIN FEATURES\nThe scenery on a battlefield can be represented by models from the Warhammer 40,000 range. These models are called terrain features to differentiate them from the models that make up an army. Terrain features are set up on the battlefield before the battle begins. Y ou can find out more about terrain features on pages 44-48.\nUnless the mission you are playing instructs you otherwise, you \nshould feel free to create an exciting battlefield using any terrain features from your collection.\nMEASURING DISTANCES\nDistances in Warhammer 40,000 are measured in inches (\"). Y ou can measure distances whenever you wish.\nWhen measuring the distance between models, measure \nbetween the closest points of the bases of the models you’re measuring to and from. If a model does not have a base, measure to the closest point of any part of that model instead. \nIf a rule says it applies ‘within’ a certain distance, it applies at \nany distance that is not more than the specified distance. For example, within 1\" means any distance that is not more than 1\" away.Hints and Tips\nWOBBLY MODELS\nSometimes you may find that a \nparticular terrain feature makes it hard for you to place a model exactly where you want to. If you delicately balance a model in place, it is very likely to fall as soon as someone nudges the table, leaving your painted model damaged or even broken. \nIn cases like this, provided it is still physically possible to place the model in the desired location, you may find it helps to leave a model in a safer position, provided both players agree and know its ‘actual’ location. If, later on, an enemy model is shooting the model, you will have to hold it back in place so that visibility can be determined.\nCORE RULES | CORE CONCEPTS\n7\nDETERMINING VISIBILITY\nWarhammer 40,000 uses true line of sight to determine visibility between models. To check this, get a ‘model’s perspective’ view by looking from behind the observing model. For the purposes of determining visibility, an observing model can see through other models in its unit, and a model’s base is also part of that model.\nMODEL VISIBLE\nIf any part of another model can be seen from any part of the observing model, that other model is visible to the observing model. \nUNIT VISIBLE\nIf one or more models in a unit is visible to the observing model, then that model’s unit is visible to the observing model. \nMODEL FULLY VISIBLE\nIf every part of another model that is facing the observing model can be seen from any part of the observing model, then that other model is said to be fully visible to the observing model, i.e. the observing model has line of sight to all parts of the other model that are facing it, without any other models or terrain features blocking visibility to any of those parts. \nUNIT FULLY VISIBLE\nIf every model in a unit is fully visible to an observing model, then that unit is fully visible to that observing model. For the purposes of determining if an enemy unit is fully visible, an observing model can see through other models in the unit it is observing.\n ■ Model Visible: If any part \nof a model can be seen, it is visible.\n ■ Unit Visible: If any model in a unit is visible, that model’s unit is visible.\n ■ Model Fully Visible: If every facing part of a model can be seen, it is fully visible.\n ■ Unit Fully Visible: If \nevery model in a unit is fully visible, that unit is fully visible.\nCORE RULES | CORE CONCEPTS\nModel Visible\nModel Fully Visible\nUnit Visible\nUnit Fully Visible\nOne model in this unit is visible, meaning the unit is visible.\n8"

        "text": "DICE\nIn order to fight a battle, you will require some six-sided \ndice (often abbreviated to D6). Some rules refer to 2D6, 3D6 and so on – in such cases, roll that many D6 and add the results together.\nIf a rule requires you to roll a D3, roll a D6 and halve the result \n(rounding up to a whole number) to get the D3 result, as shown below.\nROLLING A D3\nDICE RESULT D3 RESULT\n or 1\n or 2\n or 3\nIf a rule requires a dice roll of, for example, 3 or more, this is often abbreviated to 3+. Where several consecutive dice results are relevant to a rule, these are often shown as a range (e.g. 1-3).\nRE-ROLLS\nSome rules allow you to re-roll a dice roll, which means you get to roll some or all of the dice again. If a rule allows you to re-roll a dice roll that was made by adding several dice together (e.g. 2D6, 3D6, etc.) then, unless otherwise stated, you must re-roll all of those dice again. \nY ou can never re-roll a dice more than once, and re-rolls happen \nbefore modifiers (if any) are applied. Rules that refer to the value of an ‘unmodified’ dice roll are referring to the dice result after \nany re-rolls, but before any modifiers are applied.\n ■ Unmodified Dice : the result after re-rolls, but before \nany modifiers.\n ■A dice can never be re-rolled more than once.\n ■ You must re-roll all dice if several need adding together \n(e.g. 2D6).\n ■Re-rolls are applied before any modifiers.\nROLL-OFFS\nSome rules instruct players to roll off. To do so, both players roll \none D6, and whoever scores highest wins the roll-off. If there is a tie for the highest roll, roll off again. Neither player is allowed to re-roll or modify any of the D6 when making a roll-off.\nSEQUENCING\nWhile playing Warhammer 40,000, you’ll occasionally find that two or more rules are to be resolved at the same time. If this occurs during the battle, the player whose turn it is chooses the order. If this occurs before or after the battle, or at the start or end of a battle round, the players roll off and the winner decides the order in which those rules are resolved.Hints and Tips\nDICE ROLLING\nIn a game of Warhammer 40,000 you \nand your opponent will be rolling, and in some cases re-rolling, lots of dice. It is good practice to always \nmake sure your opponent knows what \nyou are rolling dice for, and what \nabilities and rules are in effect that \nenable you to make any re-rolls.\nMany gamers roll their dice \nsomewhere on the battlefield, but some roll their dice elsewhere, such as in a dice tray. Wherever you roll your dice, make sure you roll the dice where your opponent can see the results too. If a dice is rolled out of bounds (i.e. it rolls off your battlefield, out of your dice tray or ends up on the floor), it is very common to ignore the result of that dice and roll it again. Rolling an out-of-bounds dice again doesn’t count as having re-rolled that dice.\nIf a dice does not lie flat on your \nbattlefield after it has been thrown, it is called a cocked dice. Some players use a house rule that unless a dice is flat after it has been rolled, or unless you can balance another dice on top of a cocked dice without it sliding off, it must be rolled again. It is more common for players to roll the dice again only if they can’t be sure of the result. In any case, rolling a cocked dice again doesn’t count as having re-rolled that dice.\nCORE RULES | CORE CONCEPTS\n9"

When a model is destroyed, it is removed from the battlefield. When every model in a unit has been destroyed, that unit is destroyed.ATTACHED UNITS\nSome  Character units have the Leader ability (pg 39), \nwhich lets them merge with other units (known as Bodyguard units) to form an Attached unit. \nThe Starting Strength of an Attached unit is equal to \nthe combined Starting Strengths of all of its units (i.e. the number of models in the Leader unit added to the number of models in the Bodyguard unit). If either the Leader unit or the Bodyguard unit in an Attached unit \nis destroyed, the Starting Strength of the remaining unit \nis changed to be equal to its original Starting Strength.\nExample:  A Primaris Captain (Starting Strength 1) is \nattached to a unit of Intercessors (Starting Strength 5). This Attached unit has a Starting Strength of 6. If all the Intercessors are destroyed, the remaining Primaris Captain would revert to having a Starting Strength of 1. \nFor the purposes of rules that are triggered when a unit is destroyed, such rules are still triggered when one of the individual units that made up an Attached unit is destroyed (the Leader or the Bodyguard unit).\nExample: If a rule awards you with 1VP each time an enemy unit is destroyed, and you target an Attached \nunit, you would gain 1VP if the Bodyguard unit is \ndestroyed and 1VP if the Leader unit is destroyed (for a total of 2VP).\nCORE RULES | COMMAND PHASE\n12"

Once you have moved all of your units, progress to the Reinforcements step of your Movement phase.\nEach time you move a unit, you can move any of its models you \nchoose to. The controlling player chooses the order in which to \nmove their models. Whenever you move a model, you can pivot \nit and/or change its position on the battlefield along any path, but no part of its base can be moved across an enemy model or cross the edge of the battlefield. It can be moved over friendly models as if they were not there if you wish, but it cannot end its move on top of another model.

When a model makes any kind of move, it can be moved over a terrain feature but not through it (so models can’t move through a wall, for example, but can climb up or over it). \nA model can be moved over terrain features that \nare 2\" or less in height as if they were not there. \nA model can be moved vertically in order to climb up or down any terrain features that are taller than this, counting the vertical distance up and/or down as part of its move.

Note this also means that Monster and Vehicle models that can Fly  can be moved \nover other Monster and Vehicle models when making such a move. However, models that can Fly  cannot end their move on \ntop of any other models or within Engagement Range of any enemy models.\nWhen a model that can Fly  starts or ends a move on a terrain \nfeature, instead of measuring the path it has moved across the \nbattlefield, you instead measure its path ‘through the air’ , as shown in the diagram below.\nIn this example the Tyranid Prime makes a \nNormal move of 12\" to end on top of the ruin. \nBecause it can Fly  it can move directly over the \nenemy Terminators as if they were not there, and it is the diagonal distance through the air \nthat is measured.\nA The Von Ryan’s \nLeaper Advances \ntowards the building. \nIt moves a total of 9\", \nmoving freely over \nthe pipe as it is only \n2\" in height.\nB The building is taller \nthan 2\" so the vertical \ndistance of 3\" must \nbe counted as part of \nthe move.\n12\"\nA\nB\n3\"\n ■ Fly models can move over enemy \nmodels when they make a Normal, \nAdvance or Fall Back move.\n ■ Fly models that start or end a move \non a terrain feature measure distance moved through the air when they make a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move.\n15"

        "text": "1\n2\n4\n1 A unit of 20 Termagants targets a Terminators unit with their Fleshborers. \nAs these weapons all have the same profile, the controlling player \nchooses to use the fast dice rolling method. \n2 Each has an Attacks characteristic of 1, so the controlling player rolls \ntwenty D6. Seven of the results are greater than or equal to the \nFleshborers’ Ballistic Skill of 4+, so seven hits are scored, and seven \nWound rolls are then made. \n3 The Strength characteristic of those attacks is 5, which is equal to the \nToughness of a Terminator, so rolls of 4+ are required to successfully \nwound the target. Of those seven rolls, five successfully wound. \n4 As all the attacks have a Damage characteristic of 1, and as the saving \nthrows required for the Terminators are all the same, the Space Marines player can continue to use the fast dice rolling method and make all of \nthose saving throws at the same time, even though strictly you should \nallocate attacks beforehand. \n5 The attacks all have an Armour Penetration characteristic of -1, so in this \ninstance, even though the Terminators have an invulnerable saving throw, their normal Save characteristic will afford them a better chance of \nsurvival. The saving throws rolled result in a 1, 2, 4, 5 and 5, meaning that \ntwo are failed.\n6 The Space Marines player now has to allocate those two attacks, one at a time. One Terminator model has already lost two wounds earlier in the \nbattle, so they must allocate attacks to that model first. This means that \nmodel loses its last remaining wound (Terminator models have a Wounds \ncharacteristic of 3), and is destroyed. The last attack is allocated to a \ndifferent model, and so that model suffers one wound. Hints and Tips\nFAST DICE ROLLING\nThe rules for making attacks have been \nwritten assuming you will resolve them one at a time. However, it is possible to speed up your battles by rolling the dice for similar attacks together. In order to make several attacks at once, all of the attacks must have the same Ballistic Skill (if it’s a ranged attack) or the same Weapon Skill (if it’s a melee attack). They \nmust also have the same Strength and \nArmour Penetration characteristics, they must inflict the same Damage, they must be affected by the same abilities, and they must be directed at the same unit. If this is the case, make all of the Hit rolls at the same time, then all of the Wound rolls. Your opponent can then allocate the attacks one at a time, making the saving throws and suffering damage each time as appropriate.\nNote that if all the models in the target \nunit would require the same saving throw against the attacks, and the order in which the attacks are allocated would make no difference, then your opponent can make \nall their saving throws at the same time, \nand can do so as soon as the Wound rolls have been made. If they do, they then allocate the attacks that resulted in failed saving throws one at a time, inflicting the damage as appropriate even though, strictly speaking, saving throws should be made after attacks have been allocated. In any case, remember that if the target unit contains a model that has already lost any wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase, the controlling player must allocate further attacks to that model until either it is destroyed, or all the attacks have been saved or resolved.\nIf the attacks being allocated to a target \ninflict random damage, you cannot use \nthe fast dice rolling approach exactly as stated above – you will need to roll the dice one at a time. Consider several attacks with a Damage characteristic of D3 being allocated to a target containing models with two wounds each. As excess damage is lost each time a model is destroyed, the order in which the attacks are allocated and resolved becomes important. If the results of those D3s were 1, then 2, then 3, the attacks would result in a total of two destroyed models, but applying them in the order 3, then 2, then 1 would result in two models being destroyed and a third being damaged with only one wound remaining. As such, the rolls should be made one at \na time.\nCORE RULES | MAKING ATTACKS\n24"

Each time an attack made with \nsuch a weapon successfully wounds an Attached unit (pg 39), if a Character model in that unit is visible to the attacking model, the attacking model’s player can choose to have that attack allocated to that Character model instead of following the normal attack sequence.\n ■ When targeting an Attached unit, the attacking model’s player can have the attack allocated to a Character model in that unit visible to the bearer. BLAST \nHigh-explosives can fell several warriors in a single blast, but firing them where your comrades will get caught in the ensuing detonation is simply unwise.\nWeapons with \n[BLAST]  in their profile are known as \nBlast weapons, and they make a random number of \nattacks.

Each time a unit is selected \nto shoot or fight, if one or more models attack with Hazardous weapons, then after that unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must take one Hazardous test for each Hazardous weapon that was just used by rolling one D6. For each roll of 1, that test is failed and one model in that unit equipped with a Hazardous weapon is destroyed (selected by the \ncontrolling player), unless that model is a Character, \nMonster or Vehicle, in which case it suffers 3 mortal wounds instead. Note that if you selected a Character model in an Attached unit, the mortal wounds suffered must be allocated to that model first, even if there is another model in that unit that has lost one or more wounds or has had attacks allocated to it this phase. \nExample:  A unit of five models make five attacks \nwith ranged weapons with the \n[HAZARDOUS]  ability. \nAfter the unit has finished shooting, its controlling player rolls five D6. One of the results is a 1, and as no models in the unit are Characters, Monsters or Vehicles, one of those models is destroyed.\n ■ After a unit shoots or fights, roll one Hazardous test (one D6) for each Hazardous weapon used. For each 1, one model equipped with a Hazardous weapon is destroyed (Characters, Monsters and Vehicles suffer 3 mortal wounds instead). \nDEVASTATING WOUNDS\nSome weapons can inflict strikes of such power that they make a mockery of armour and can cleave through several foes. \nWeapons with \n[DEVASTATING WOUNDS]  in their profile \nare known as Devastating Wounds weapons. Each \ntime an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Wound inflicts a number of mortal wounds on the target equal to the Damage characteristic of that weapon and the attack sequence ends.\nExample:  An attack made with a Devastating \nWounds weapon with a Damage characteristic of \n2 scores a Critical Wound. Instead of allocating \nthe attack and making saving throws normally, the target suffers 2 mortal wounds.\n ■ A Critical Wound inflicts mortal wounds equal to the weapon’s Damage characteristic, instead of any normal damage.SUSTAINED HITS\nSome weapons strike in a flurry of blows, tearing the foe apart with relentless ferocity. \nWeapons with \n[SUSTAINED HITS X]  in their profile are \nknown as Sustained Hits weapons. Each time an \nattack is made with such a weapon, if a Critical Hit is rolled, that attack scores a number of additional hits on the target as denoted by ‘x’.  \nExample:  A model makes an attack with a melee \nweapon with the \n[SUSTAINED HITS 2]  ability. If the \nHit roll is an unmodified 6 (a Critical Hit), then that attack scores a total of 3 hits on the target (1 from the successful Hit roll of 6, and 2 from the \n[SUSTAINED HITS 2]  ability).\n ■ [SUSTAINED HITS X] : Each Critical Hit scores ‘x’ \nadditional hits on the target.\nEXTRA ATTACKS\nSome warriors ride to battle atop trusty mounts that gore and trample nearby foes. Others wield combat weapons that deliver a frenzy of additional blows. \nWeapons with \n[EXTRA ATTACKS]  in their profile are \nknown as Extra Attacks weapons. Each time the \nbearer of such a weapon fights, it can make attacks with that weapon in addition to the one it chooses to fight with.

        "text": "CORE RULES | DATASHEETS1 DATASHEET NAME\nHere you will find the name of the unit.\n2 PROFILES\nThese contain the following characteristics \nthat tell you how mighty the models in the unit are:\nMove (M): This is the speed at which a \nmodel moves across the battlefield. If a model has a Move of ‘-’ it is unable to move at all.\nToughness (T): This reflects the model’s \nresilience against physical harm.\nSave (Sv): This indicates the protection a \nmodel’s armour gives them.\nWounds (W): Wounds represent how \nmuch damage a model can sustain before it succumbs to its injuries. If a model’s Wounds characteristic is reduced to 0, that model is destroyed.\nLeadership (Ld): This reveals how \ncourageous, determined or self-controlled a model is. The lower this number, the better a model’s Leadership is.\nObjective Control (OC): This shows how \neffectively a model can exert control over an objective on the battlefield. \n3 ABILITIES\nMany units have special abilities and rules that may apply during the game, from Core Rules shared by many units to bespoke Psychic abilities and invulnerable saves. These will be described here, along with any rules that apply when larger models such as vehicles have suffered sufficient damage.\nSome abilities are bestowed by items \nof wargear that models in a unit can be \nequipped with, and are known as Wargear abilities. These only apply while a model in the unit is equipped with the relevant item of wargear.4 WEAPONS\nWeapons are described with the following characteristics:\nRange: How far the weapon can shoot. \nWeapons with a range of ‘Melee’ are melee weapons and can only be used in close combat. All other weapons are ranged weapons.\nAttacks (A): This tells you how many attacks \nare made each time that weapon is used. \nWeapon Skill (WS): This reflects the bearer’s \nskill in wielding the relevant melee weapon.\nBallistic Skill (BS): This shows how accurate \nthe bearer is when shooting with the relevant ranged weapon.\nStrength (S): How likely the weapon is to \nwound a foe.\nArmour Penetration (AP): This represents \nthe weapon’s ability to cut through the target’s defences.\nDamage (D): The amount of damage \ninflicted by a successful wound.\n5 KEYWORDS\nDatasheets have a list of keywords, separated into Faction keywords and other keywords. The former are used when deciding which models to include in your army, but otherwise both sets of keywords are functionally the same.\n6UNIT COMPOSITION  \nAND OTHER RULES\nThis section details the number and types \nof models in the unit, and the default weapons and wargear those models are equipped with. It may also describe other interactions, such as how units with the Leader ability can attach to other units, and passenger restrictions that may apply to Transport models.\n7 WARGEAR OPTIONS\nSome datasheets have a bullet-pointed list of wargear options. When you include such a unit in your army, you can use these options to change the weapons and other wargear of models in the unit. The order you use these options in does not matter, but each can only be used once.LEADERSHIP TESTS\nIf a rule requires you to take a Leadership test for a unit, roll 2D6: if the total is greater than or equal to the best Leadership characteristic in that unit, that test is passed. Otherwise, it is failed. \nRANDOM CHARACTERISTICS\nSome characteristics are a random value instead of a number. For example, a model’s Move characteristic might be 2D6\", or a weapon’s Attacks characteristic might be D6. When a unit with a random Move characteristic is selected to move, determine the entire unit’s move distance by \nrolling the indicated number of \ndice. For all other characteristics, roll to determine the value on \nan individual, per - model or \nper-weapon basis each time that characteristic is required. \nAURA ABILITIES\nSome abilities affect multiple models or units in a given range. These are known as Aura abilities and are tagged with the word ‘ Aura’ . A model with an Aura ability is always within range of its own Aura ability. A unit can be affected by more than one Aura ability at a time, but if a unit is within range of the same \nAura ability more than once, that \nAura ability only applies to that unit once.\nPSYCHIC WEAPONS  \nAND ABILITIES\nSome weapons and abilities can only \nbe used by Psykers. Such weapons and abilities are tagged with the word ‘Psychic’ . If a Psychic weapon or ability causes any unit to suffer one or more wounds, each of those wounds is considered to have been inflicted by a Psychic Attack.\n38"

If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your \nMovement phases you can set up this unit anywhere \non the battlefield that is more than 9\" horizontally away from all enemy models.\n ■ Unit can be set up in Reserves instead of on the battlefield.\n ■ Unit can be set up in your Reinforcements \nstep, more than 9\" horizontally away from all enemy models.\nSCOUTS\nScouts form the vanguard of many armies. Unnoticed by the enemy, they range ahead of the main force.\nSome units have ‘Scouts x\"’ listed in their abilities. \nIf every model in a unit has this ability, then at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, it can make a Normal move of up to x\" as if it were your Movement phase – as can any Dedicated Transport model such a unit starts the \nbattle embarked within (provided only models with \nthis ability are embarked within that Dedicated Transport model). A unit that moves using this ability must end that move more than 9\" horizontally away from all enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their units first.\nExample:  A unit has the Scouts 6\" ability. At the \nstart of the first battle round, the controlling player can make a Normal move with that unit of up to 6\".\n ■ Scouts x\": Unit can make a Normal move of up to x\" before the first turn begins.\n ■ If embarked in a Dedicated Transport, \nthat Dedicated Transport can make this move instead.\n ■ Must end this move more than 9\" horizontally \naway from all enemy models.INFILTRATORS\nMany armies employ reconnaissance units who can sit concealed, waiting for the right moment to strike.\nDuring deployment, if every model in a unit has \nthis ability, then when you set it up, it can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9\" horizontally away from the enemy deployment zone and all enemy models.\nLEADER\nMighty heroes fight at the forefront of battle.\nSome Character units have ‘Leader’ listed on their \ndatasheets. Such Character units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.\nDuring the Declare Battle Formations step, for each \nLeader in your army, if your army also includes one \nor more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can \nselect one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.\nWhile a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is \nknown as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached \nunit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character \nmodel in that unit, even if that Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to Character models in that unit. \n ■ Before the battle, Character units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.\n ■ Attached units can only contain one Leader.\n ■ Attacks cannot be allocated to Character \nmodels in Attached units.DEPLOYMENT ABILITIES\nSome abilities are used during deployment, or when setting a unit up – either on the battlefield or \ninto Reserves. These are known as Deployment abilities, and some widespread examples of these are presented below.\nCORE RULES | DEPLOYMENT ABILITIES\n39"

These rules help to bring your battlefield to life and introduce a vital tactical dimension to your games. TERRAIN FEATURES\nBattlefields are populated with terrain features that \nyour models will need to move over or around, and which can partially or fully block line of sight between models. The rules on the following pages apply to the most common terrain features on the battlefields of the 41st Millennium. Unless otherwise stated, models can move up, over and down terrain features following the normal rules for movement.\nMany terrain features follow the normal rules for \ndetermining visibility between models (pg 8), but some interact differently; in either case, this is stated on the following pages. Terrain features cannot be selected as the target of an attack. \nBENEFIT OF COVER\nShattered ruins and twisted wreckage afford much-needed shelter from enemy salvoes. Even heavily armoured warriors unfazed by small arms fire are thankful for such cover when foes bring their biggest guns to bear.\nModels can sometimes gain a measure of protection \nfrom terrain features. The rules on pages 45-48 detail the conditions under which a terrain feature confers \nthe Benefit of Cover on a model.\nEach time a ranged attack is allocated to a model \nthat has the Benefit of Cover, add 1 to the saving throw made for that attack (excluding invulnerable saving throws). Models with a Save characteristic of 3+ or better cannot have the Benefit of Cover against attacks with an Armour Penetration characteristic of 0.

Crystal moons, derelict space hulks, carnivorous death worlds and war-ravaged cityscapes are just a few of the fantastical landscapes that can be recreated.\nBattlefields are typically created by placing Battlezones \nnext to each other. Battlezones are Citadel terrain sets that include two boards (each approximately 22\" by 30\" in size) and a range of terrain features designed to be set up evenly on those boards for the best Warhammer 40,000 gaming experience. Don’t worry if your battlefield doesn’t match these requirements, but keep in mind that playing on a battlefield that is either a barren wasteland or filled to overflowing with terrain features may give an advantage to \none side or the other.\nBelow is an example of a battlefield set up for a Strike Force \nbattle, with a good mixture of different terrain features fairly distributed across the battlefield. Their placement will create a dynamic gaming experience that doesn’t favour one player over the other. \nImportantly, some terrain features that block visibility have \nbeen placed near the middle of the battlefield, ensuring that it is not easy to see from one side of the battlefield to the other. Battlefields where this is not the case can advantage armies that rely on shooting, or disadvantage \narmies that rely on melee. There is also sufficient room \nfor larger models such as vehicles to manoeuvre around the terrain features, especially near the edges, without getting trapped. \nMatched Play Focused: This is a Strike Force battlefield (44\" x 60\") set up with an aspirational number and mixture of terrain features. Their \nplacement creates a battlefield that does not give an advantage to one player or the other, making it well suited to an aspirational matched play game. While this battlefield uses lots of Battlezone: Fronteris terrain features, you could achieve the same gaming experience using many different kinds of terrain, bearing in mind the concepts discussed above.\nCORE RULES | EXAMPLE BATTLEFIELDS\n49"

If a mission uses objective markers, it will state where they are located on the battlefield. These can be represented using any suitable marker, but we recommend using round markers that are 40mm in diameter.\nWhen setting objective markers up on the battlefield, place them \nso they are centred on the point specified by the mission. When \nmeasuring distances to and from objective markers, measure to and from the closest part of them. Models can move over objective markers as if they were not there, but they cannot end a move on top of an objective marker.\nAt the start of the battle, each objective marker on the battlefield \nis said to be contested, and so is not controlled by either player. To control an objective marker, a player will first need to move models within range of it. A model is within range of an objective marker if it is within 3\" horizontally and 5\" vertically of that objective marker.\nEvery model has an Objective Control (OC) characteristic listed \non its datasheet. To determine a player’s Level of Control over an objective marker, add together the OC characteristics of all the models from that player’s army that are within range of that \nobjective marker. A player will control an objective marker at the \nend of any phase if their Level of Control over it is greater than their opponent’s.

When setting up terrain features, you can place them where an objective marker would be, so long as you can reposition that objective marker directly on top of that terrain \nfeature and it lies flat, without \noverhanging any part of it. That objective marker should still be more than 1\" away from all impassable parts of that terrain feature (such as the walls of a ruin) so that there is sufficient room for models to move around it. \nIf it is not possible to set up terrain \nfeatures or objective markers in this way, and both players agree, you can nudge the positions of any terrain feature or objective marker so that these conditions are satisfied. Of course, the final position of an objective marker should \nstill be as close as possible to the \nlocation indicated on your mission’s deployment map, but if both players are happy to tweak the battlefield arrangement to forge a stronger narrative, you should feel free to do so.\n58\nAttacker’s Battlefield Edge Defender’s Battlefield Edge Centre of Battlefield\n"
